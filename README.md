Looking at the data, I'm becoming interested in what differences we might find between different species.
Consequently, my next step in the analysis is to split the data apart by location, and look at the
phylogenetic trees for each of these locations.
Perhaps some pattern will emerge that I can study further.


Making some changes now.
This will be an example to send to commit on github.
