Ran the location trees.
Interesting data.
Thinking about some other studies now.

Looking at the data, I'm becoming interested in what differences we might find between different species.
Consequently, my next step in the analysis is to split the data apart by location, and look at the
phylogenetic trees for each of these locations.
Perhaps some pattern will emerge that I can study further.
